Creating Object Oriented Neural Network For Educational &amp; Understanding Purpose Only


Hello All, 

I am a Software Developer, who is highly interested in Neural Networks.

I have learned creating Neural Networks using multiple libraries, but that never gave me feel of satisfaction. Also, there are many codes and tutorials available which explains neural networks in deep or try to code neural network from scratch but I noticed that in process of making efficient and lesser code, they compromise understandability.

So, I thought to create Neural Network from Scratch with completely Object Oriented approach. I am trying to make the code such that, you can understand the components and configurations just by looking over the Java POJOs.

E.g. I have created a Neuron class and then 2 child classes InputNeuron & NonInputNeuron. Just so that whoever see the class first time understand that gradient, cache weights aren't needed in the InputNeuron but needed in the NonInputNeurons.

Here, you will see, that the code is too lengthy, because my aim is not to create an efficient Neural Network but an "understandable neural network". 

Always open to suggestions and contributions, also, I am in the middle of the code, so you will see some code not in the Object Oriented style or replications, but my weekend is over, will clean it up on next weekend !

Code is highly inspired from <a href="https://github.com/yacineMahdid/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20from%20Scratch%20in%20Java">here</a>
